# AutoEssayWriter
This Python script uses Selenium to automatically write small articles using essay titles from a file input (placed in same directory as AutoEssayWriter.py) mainly using the website https://essaygenius.ai/.

I have tried implementing different AI writers (BardAI & ChatGPT) to write the essays instead of EssayGenius which can be seen through the 3 different Python files directed to the 3 different AI writers.
